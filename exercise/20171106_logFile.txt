1. Split merged cells B2:G2
2. Cells B3:G5 contain the same variable, so they should be in the same column
3. Called the new column CWT (Cell Wall Thickness)
4. Fix column A => we have 6 replicates per condition
5. We do not need the Mean column (H)
6. Renamed column A: HEVs (Hyphae with fungal EVs)
7. The table name became a Column in the table
8. There is a value recorded as text an not as a number => fix it
